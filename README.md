Do you love Beer? Do you love it so much that you've gone to so many breweries and drank so much beer that you can't remember which one's you've been to and which ones are your favorite? Then you NEED Deja-Bru! 

Features of Deja-Bru:
* Search for Breweries by City or State and find breweries on a map 
* Keep a running list of the breweries you have visited
* Label breweries as a favorite and leaves comments so you remember why it's your favorite! (Since you forgot after your 6th pint!)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

We recently were approved to use the Untappd API so we hope to use that data as instead of OpenBreweryDB at a later time. We are also looking to add user authentication to this app and create our own back-end for this project.
